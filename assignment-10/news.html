    <h2>Air India vs UK Law Firm Over Alleged Threat To Crash Victims' FamiliesAt </h2>least 274 people were killed in the crash that occurred soon after London-bound AI 171 took off at around 1.30pm from Ahmedabad airport on June 12.

    <p>The families of the victims of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad last month have accused the Tata Group-owned airline of "forcing" them to make financial disclosures under the "threat of receiving no advance compensation", even as the carrier "categorically rejected" the allegations and said efforts are being made to process the payments. <br><br>

    "Air India cannot process these payments in an information vacuum. In order to facilitate payments, Air India has sought basic information to establish family relationships to ensure that the advance payments are received by those entitled to them," the airline said Friday. <br><br>

    The Tata Group had announced a compensation of Rs 1 crore for families of those killed in the crash that occurred soon after London-bound AI 171 took off from Ahmedabad airport at around 1.30pm on June 12. The plane crashed into the residential quarters of BJ Medical College doctors in Meghaninagar area before going up in flames. Only one of the 242 passengers and crew members onboard survived the accident. The remaining victims were from those in the college and around the premises.</p>
